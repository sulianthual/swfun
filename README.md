code by Sulian Thual (2019)

Matlab code to integrate a very Simple Shallow-Water Model (with rotation). 

references: github: https://github.com/sulianthual/stochasticskeleton

<h4>Introduction: </h4>

The code can be useful to play around with model parameters to obtain and understand different model regimes (that are relevant to geophysical fluid dynamics). It was used for a midterm evaluation of an undergraduate course. 

<h4>Instructions: </h4>

1) You need matlab installed.

2) Run and edit the file midterm.m. Follow the file Instructions.pdf in the folder ./documentation.
